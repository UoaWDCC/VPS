[git-wiki-skeleton](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-skeleton): This is the repo that you should fork or use as a template. It uses the [jekyll remote theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) functionality that allows you to create your own wiki based on git-wiki-theme. By using the remote functionality you can automatically keep your wiki always updated with latest features from the **git-wiki-theme**, but you can also fully customize it.
